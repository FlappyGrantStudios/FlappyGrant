# FlappyGrant

FlappyGrant is a website containing ***custom-made*** games never seen before!

**Played all the games?** Email us, so we can make new ones!

## Features

- **A fully custom** authentication system. *Maybe the project will use Google Auth when it's improved.*
- **The official currency** of FlappyGrant, added in previous attempts at the website. This also includes transferring grantbux, receiving grantbux, creating gift cards, redeeming gift cards, etc.
- **A vast** catalog of *fully custom-made* browser games.

## Contributing

- Why else is the website open-source with an [MIT License](LICENSE.md)... surely you can fork FlappyGrant- right? ***YES YOU CAN!!!*** In fact, you can work on the main website, too!
- Saddly, you can't edit the backend's code, nor read it. It's kind of open for security breaches if we make it public.
